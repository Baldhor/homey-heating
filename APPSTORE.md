# Homey heating scheduler for Athom Homey

Easily control the temperature of your thermostats.

## How does this work and what can it do on Homey?

This app controls the target temperature if your thermostats based on (many) *heating plans*. A heating plan is list of set points. At each set point, the associated target temperature is applied to a list devices.

A heating plan can be associated with either zones or devices. If a heating plan is associated with a zone, the heating plan is associated with all themorstats inside that zone. Child zones are not evaluated (yet).

You can find more details, a short manual, as well as release notes online [https://homey-heating.mskg.app](https://homey-heating.mskg.app).
