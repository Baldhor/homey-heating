This app controls the target temperature if your thermostats based on *heating plans*. A heating plan is list of set points. At each set point, the associated target temperature is applied to a list devices.

A heating plan can be associated with either zones or devices. If a heating plan is associated with a zone, the heating plan is associated with all themorstats inside that zone. Child zones are not evaluated.
