title:  What happens on holidays? ... when I'm not at home?

The heating plans support exceptions for the following events:

* One day at home
* One day not at home
* Sleeping
* Holiday

For each plan, you can define exceptional temperatures that are applied to all thermostats associated with your plan. When you define an exceptional temperature, and the event is active, the plan's schedules are paused.

The events *One day at home*, *One day not at home*, and *Sleeping* are reset every night at 00:00 and the normal *Automatic* schedule applies. The event *Holiday* is not automatically canceled and has to be reset manually using *Flows*.

## I want more control

If the holiday "thing" is not your style, you can automate it yourself. Plans can be enabled and disabled manually or via *Flow*. If a heating plan is disabled, it is not applied.

### Flow activity cards

The follwing activity cards are provided

* Apply all active heating plans
* Apply a specific heating plan, even when it is not activated
* Set heating mode, see above
* Enable/disable a specific plan
