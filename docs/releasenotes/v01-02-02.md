## Fixes
- During device removal OnInit cycle of driver seems not to be run. A workarround has been implemented #94
- Try to implement workarround for #68. Danfoss seems to reject temperature if it is already set.
- Check if a device is available before setting target_temperature, #95

## Backend
- Bumped dependencies (d3, material-ui, mocha, @types/*)
