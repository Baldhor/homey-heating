## Fixes
- This is a fork of 1.2.4 official version!
- Virtual Thermostat reset target temperature of underlying devices every 5 minutes
- Ignore watched target_temperature, and always enforce it!
- A change in schedule should not set target_temperature if we are not in automatic mode
- Added unfreeze preset and adjusted warm and warmer presets
- Create the tmp folder during build

## Docs
Updated README.txt and forced to bump version due to Apps Store requirements.
