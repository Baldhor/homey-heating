## Major Changes and Improvements

### **Add**: Translation to Dutch #30
Proud to have a dutch version now. If you find any errors, feel free to drop me a note.

### **Add**: Virtual thermostats
Each plan can be added as a virtual thermostat device to Homey. This allows to override the temperature per "zone." The devices have the following capabilities
- `onoff` Enabled, disables the plan
- `target_temperature` Sets that value for all devices associated with the plan
- `measured_temperature` Show the mean value of all temperature readings from all devices related to the plan 

### **Add**: Graphical plan overview #44
There is now a graphical overview of your schedule directly available on the summary of the plan. Also, the plan editing screen has been reworked to fit the more dense information.
